# Add-on: Spoolman

Spoolman is a self-hosted web service designed to help you efficiently manage your 3D printer filament spools and monitor their usage.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Add-on have some options, that uses as Spoolman [env](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/blob/master/.env.example) options.

Backup you spoolman.db before any updates.

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the Spoolman itself.

Possible values are:

- `DEBUG`
- `INFO`
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`
- `CRITICAL`

Logs will only be reported if the level is higher than the level set here.

Default if not set: `INFO`

### Option: `auto_backup`

Automatic nightly backup for SQLite databases.

### Option: `base_path`

Set this if you want to host Spoolman at a sub-path.

For example: if you want the root to be e.g. `myhost.com/spoolman`, set this to `/spoolman`.

### Option: `debug_mode`

If enabled, the client will accept requests from any host. This can be useful when developing, but is also a security risk.

## Backup and restore

Add-on store files to own directory in `addon_configs`.

You can backup database by downloading `spoolman.db` stored there.

To restore database, stop add-on, then replace `spoolman.db` with another one.

## Known issues and limitations

You tell me.
